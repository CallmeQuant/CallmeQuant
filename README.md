## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an independent researcher fascinated by the intersection of **statistics**, **machine learning**, and **time series**.  
My work focuses on blending **mathematical rigor** with **practical modeling**, drawing from areas such as **high-dimensional statistics**, **learning theory**, **probabilistic modeling**, **generative models**, and **state-space systems**.

Iâ€™m especially interested in how theory can guide the design of models that explain, predict, and generate complex data â€” particularly in real-world, high-dimensional settings.

*I enjoy exploring connections between mathematics, computation, and application domains â€” and Iâ€™m always curious about how theory and practice can inform each other.*
