## Hello 👋

I am an independent researcher working across **mathematical statistics**, **machine learning**, and **time-series analysis**.
My work focuses on developing and analyzing methods that blend **rigorous statistical theory** with **modern computational modeling**, particularly for high-dimensional or structured data.

I am interested in collaborations involving **theoretical analysis**, **modeling frameworks**, and **computational methodology** motivated by real-world complex data.

## 🔬 Research Interests

### **Statistical Methodology**

* High-dimensional statistics
* Model selection and regularization
* Nonparametric and semiparametric inference
* Missing-data mechanisms (MAR/MNAR)
* Robustness and contamination models

### **Learning Theory & Generative Modeling**

* Empirical processes, concentration, and generalization
* Approximate inference: variational Bayes, MCMC, stochastic approximations
* Deep generative models: flows, diffusion models, energy-based models

### **Time-Series & Stochastic Systems**

* State-space models (linear, nonlinear, SSMs, SDEs)
* Diffusion-based forecasting
* Representation learning for sequential data

## 📘 Research Perspective

My work aims to build connections between:

* **Statistical theory** (empirical processes, concentration, asymptotics)
* **Modeling and computation** (variational inference, SDEs, diffusion-based models)
* **Applications** where structure and uncertainty play a central role (biostatistics, forecasting, high-dimensional regimes)

I am particularly motivated by methodologies that offer **both statistical guarantees and practical applicability**, and I enjoy collaborations where theory, computation, and application inform each other.
